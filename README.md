The official website for [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) built by the community for the community :heart:

## Milestone 1.0

We are doing a very lightweight release with just a homepage and some hyperlinks - [**Milestone 1.0**](https://github.com/postcss/postcss.org/milestones/1.0). If you would like to report any bugs or similar before that, let us know.

## Gitter

We use Gitter[[?]](https://gitter.im) to keep each other up-to date on what's going on with the current status of the project as well as status meetings. You can join our Gitter channel [here](https://gitter.im/postcss/postcss.org)

There is a bunch of documentation on how to work on `postcss.org` in the `docs/` folder, [`Getting Started`](docs/getting-started.md) is a good place to begin!

### Technical specifications

`postcss.org` uses [Statinamic](http://moox.io/statinamic/) as a static site generator. Statinamic is based on [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), a user interface library made by Facebook. Other top of that we use CSS Modules, Redux, Babel, webpack and (obviously) PostCSS.
