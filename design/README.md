# Open Source Design for `postcss.org`

Quickly get into the iterative way of designing for `postcss.org`

## Zeplin

Currently we host the mockups in this directory and in a [Zeplin Project](https://zpl.io/TJT9K5). If you need access to the Zeplin project let [Stephen Way](https://github.com/stephenway) know or submit an request in [issue](https://github.com/postcss/postcss.org/issues/133).

Maybe you just looking out for a quick [sneak peak](https://scene.zeplin.io/project/56a3fb9180974a77015a1c2b)?

## Gulp

1. Install packages from `package.json` by `npm install`

2. Install [Sketch Tools](http://www.sketchapp.com/tool/) to slice images from `.sketch` files. Simply run `sh install.sh` from downloaded directory when installed.

* `gulp sketch` for slicing sketches from `./src/sketch/*.sketch` to images in `./src/template/`

* `gulp minify` to minify SVG files in `./src/images`.
